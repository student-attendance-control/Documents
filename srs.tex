\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The product which will be covered throughout the document is a student attendance control system using RFID technology. This document includes all the specification for prototype versions. The document covers SRS for both embedded and web platform.

\section{Document Conventions}

When the name 'device' is mentioned, it means document points to the hardware that will read the RFID card, but in some cases device point to something else, in that case reader is notified.

When 'report' is mentioned in the report, it means SRS refers to attendance lists or information of an individual student.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document's reader is the instructor and as well as the students of the Software Engineering class. Document begins with introducing the project and its internals, challenges and design considerations. 

\section{Project Scope}

Attendance is a job that is still being done by the instructor manually. This project aims to change this with a low cost device and help university to switch a fully autonomous attendance monitoring system with great benefits. This project will also inspire next generation under graduate students to contribute their environment and making it better.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Since device contains a microcontroller, it is hard to store large amounts of data on it, options such as SD card or flash memory means more cost and complexity to the product. And then again WiFi protocol is a big issue in embedded systems since it also requires large amount of data structures and complex communication protocols, thus in the development process it might be a problem to communicate to a web server, fluently and securely. 

Also device can be designed with plug-n-play solutions such as Arduino, but it is a 'plan b' because first the project must be professional and second it has to be easily mass produceable.

Web server is funded by the owner of the project which will be hard to maintain by them, therefore money is another constraint.

\section{User Documentation}
The device and web server will be provided with a 'Quick Start Guide' and with hands-on training, also device support will be available until students graduate.

Also for developers, project will release a ’Communication Protocol Guide’.

\section{System Specifications }

Web Server
\begin{itemize}

\item  Data Storage Platform: SQL Server 2019
\item  Data Query Language:  T-SQL
\item  Web Service: XML
\item  Language: ASP.NET
\item  Data Encryption: Hash

\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
The Device
\begin{itemize}

\item  MCU: ST STM32F0
\item  WiFi SoC: Espressif ESP8266
\item  MIFARE RFID Front End: NXP MFRC522 
\item  RTC: Dallas Semi. DS1307  
\item  Battery: 7.4V 2C Lithium Polymer
\item Interface: 5mm TH RGB led and Buzzer.

\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}

The device uses RFID technology to met with \textit{FR-1}. Firstly project needs a database so it can match the id inside an RFID card to a student, for this SQL Server 2019 will be used (\textit{FR-8} and \textit{FR-12}). This database containing students RFID ID's and student informations will be crated manually by the project owners based on Appendix A.

Device will create an electrical field around it and when a card approaches it will energize the card and read the content of card with MFRC522 IC (According to datasheet IC is capable to met with \textit{NFP-1})   and format it with JSON and Hash encryption along with time information using DS1307 and send it (this mets with \textit{NFP-2} see 4.3 for more detail)  to web servers with HTTP requests (every device can send HTTP request so \textit{NFP-2} is met) using ESP8266 SoC (\textit{FR-3}, \textit{FR-4}, \textit{FR-5} and \textit{FR-6}), then web server will compare that data with its database to see if there is a match with using ASP.NET \textit{Data} libraries and SQL Sever DBs. Then web server will send status to the device using again ASP.NET and HTTP requests and device will act accordingly (\textit{FR-2}). 

Device also will monitor its battery status with ADC modules of MCU to inform user when its about to run out (\textit{FR-7}). 

There will be a login page at the web server again made with ASP.NET, no feature will be available until user logs in. Every data of user will be recorded on DB (\textit{FR-11}).
